  <h1 class="abouth1">About</h1>
  <p class="abouttext">A person who tries to never miss an opportunity to groom technical and non-technical skills and has the mettle to deal any situation with composure is what that counts me as  one. 
Organized various events and functions in the college where I learnt numerous skills and got to know about my ability of  how to handle different things while working in a team on the stage and off the stage.
Being the head in core committee for fest and lead at sponsorship, got me the exposure how to deal with the outside world while maintaining peace at inner level. 

I am a person who  believes in  Charity and try to help others .Winter inter clothes donation drive, Teaching the unprivileged are some of the initiatives I took during my college time. 
Positive attitude towards my work, my honesty and punctuality further adds to my paraphernalia. 
My short-term goal is to acquire a position in a good company where I can enhance my skills and get experience. My long-term goal is to get a respectable position in that organization and to help others with whatever I have gained and learnt.</p>
