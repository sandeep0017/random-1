  <p class="abouttext">Hi, My Name is Sandeep Kumar Gautam. I am from Delhi. I have done my graduation in B.Tech ECE from Ambedkar Institute of Technology and Schooling from DPS Mathura Road.
Being a fresher I Don’t have professional experience of the corporate world but saying that I don’t have any experience will be incorrect as I am a person who tries to never miss an opportunity to groom my technical and non-technical skills I was the part of the student council of my college and organized various events and functions in the college where I learnt numerous things that how to handle different things while working in a team on the stage and off the stage. I was the part of the Core Team of the College fest. I worked as the head of PR Team and sponsorship team through these activities I got the opportunity to enhance my skills and knowledge and got the exposure how to deal with the outside world.
I have done internships and training both in tech and non-tech I have done 3 months training in business development from productivity experts in which I have to directly deal with the people I also have done 2 months training in embedded systems.
I also have good knowledge and experience in the technical field as I have worked in a robotics team and went to different robotics competitions such as robot race in different colleges.
I also believe in Charity and try to help others whenever I get any chance to do so. I was the member of the NSS Society and organized various social activities like winter clothes donation drive, Teaching the unprivileged.
My Strengths are my positive attitude towards my work, my honesty and punctuality. My weakness is that I am a bit emotional but I am working to control it.
My short-term goal is to acquire a position in a good company where I can enhance my skills and get experience. My long-term goal is to get a respectable position in that organization and to help others with whatever I have gained and learnt.
Talking about my hobbies I love to play musical instruments like guitar and drum I was the member of the college band as a guitarist and a drummer.

Coming to my family I have a family of 6 members, My parents and 4 brothers including me.</p>
